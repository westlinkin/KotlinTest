KotlinTest
----------
This is a basic example for an Android app using the language [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

The App shows a `RecyclerView` with 100 items, when each item is clicked, a toast with item content will show. You can download the apk [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/westlinkin/KotlinTest/master/app-debug.apk).

From this application you can see that after using the language `Kotlin`, the code is reduced by ~30%. 

Hope this helps. Enjoy.
